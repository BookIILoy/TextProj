"O governo brasileiro quer censurar as teorias da conspiração e ainda assim aqui está, espalhando teorias da conspiração: "" O governo brasileiro suspeita que os ataques de Elon Musk ao ministro Alexandre de Moraes e agora também diretamente ao presidente Lula estão sendo feitos em cooperativa com deputados bolsonaristas..."" relata a CNN.  A CNN publicou este segmento embora admitisse que “Ainda não temos provas sobre isso, está sendo investigado”.  Boa sorte em encontrar evidências porque não há nenhuma!  Fui convidado há muitos meses para palestrar no Fórum pela Liberdade no Rio Grande do Sul. Antes de chegar, meus colegas jornalistas brasileiros, David Agape e Eli Viera, me pediram para ver se havia algum arquivo do Twitter no Brasil.  Olhei e descobri que havia. O que descobrimos nos chocou: Alexandre de Moraes e outros funcionários do governo ameaçaram processar criminalmente o advogado do Twitter no Brasil se ele não entregasse informações *privadas* e *pessoais*, incluindo números de telefone das pessoas e suas mensagens diretas pessoais!  Publiquei os Arquivos do Twitter logo após desembarcar em Porto Alegre.  *Ninguém* além de David, Eli e mais um colega meu sabia que eu iria publicar o Twitter Files Brasil.  Depois que ficou claro que muitos brasileiros estavam interessados em falar comigo sobre os Arquivos do Twitter, adiei em uma semana meu retorno aos EUA. Depois que decidi fazer isso, o Diputado Federal Marcel Van Hattem cancelou a sua viagem há muito planejada a Bruxelas.  Conheci Van Hattem em Londres no ano passado, numa conferência, e ele estava no Fórum pela Liberdade, em Porto Alegre. Aceitei com gratidão a oferta de Van Hattem de ser apresentado a diversas pessoas que ele conhecia no Brasil.  É isso. Essa é toda a “coordenação”. Se a CNN tivesse feito o seu trabalho, poderia ter aprendido tudo isto comigo antes de publicar a sua “desinformação”. Na verdade, a CNN me entrevistou há duas noites e contei aos dois repórteres como surgiu o Twitter Files – Brasil. Aparentemente, os repórteres da CNN não conversam entre si.  Aparentemente, a CNN também não fez o dever de casa com Elon Musk. Com Elon, o que você vê é o que você obtém. Ele respondeu publicamente ao Twitter Files Brasil. Não falamos sobre eles nem nos correspondemos sobre eles. Ele ouviu falar deles no mesmo momento em que o mundo ouviu falar deles.

"Read this.  NPR veteran describes the transformation of NPR from a news to an activist organization after Trump's election:  ""During most of my tenure [at NPR], an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding.  In recent years, however, that has changed. Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population...  Like many unfortunate things, the rise of advocacy took off with Donald Trump. As in many newsrooms, his election in 2016 was greeted at NPR with a mixture of disbelief, anger, and despair... But what began as tough, straightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency [italics mine].  Persistent rumors that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the election became the catnip that drove reporting. At NPR, we hitched our wagon to Trump’s most visible antagonist, Representative Adam Schiff...  The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.  But when the Mueller report found no credible evidence of collusion, NPR’s coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming...  It’s bad to blow a big story.  What’s worse is to pretend it never happened, to move on with no mea culpas, no self-reflection...  [Hunter Biden's] laptop was newsworthy. But the timeless journalistic instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched. During a meeting with colleagues, I listened as one of NPR’s best and most fair-minded journalists said it was good we weren’t following the laptop story because it could help Trump [italics mine]...  Over the course of the pandemic, a number of investigative journalists made compelling, if not conclusive, cases for the lab leak. But at NPR, we weren’t about to swivel or even tiptoe away from the insistence with which we backed the natural origin story...  [Our new director] declared that diversity—on our staff and in our audience—was the overriding mission... Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace. Journalists were required to ask everyone we interviewed their race, gender, and ethnicity (among other questions), and had to enter it in a centralized tracking system [italics mine]. We were given unconscious bias training sessions. A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to 'start talking about race.'  There’s an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they should be framed. It’s frictionless—one story after another about instances of supposed racism, transphobia, signs of the climate apocalypse, Israel doing something bad, and the dire threat of Republican policies. It’s almost like an assembly line.  The mindset prevails in choices about language. In a document called NPR Transgender Coverage Guidance—disseminated by news management—we’re asked to avoid the term biological sex... The mindset animates bizarre stories—on how The Beatles and bird names are racially problematic, and others that are alarmingly divisive; justifying looting, with claims that fears about crime are racist; and suggesting that Asian Americans who oppose affirmative action have been manipulated by white conservatives.  More recently, we have approached the Israel-Hamas war and its spillover onto streets and campuses through the intersectional lens that has jumped from the faculty lounge to newsrooms. Oppressor versus oppressed...  I looked at voter registration for our newsroom. In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.""  https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust",2024-04,2,4

"𝕮𝖔𝖘𝖒𝖎𝖈 𝕮𝖍𝖗𝖔𝖓𝖎𝖈𝖑𝖊𝖘 SpaceX Achieves Ambitious Goal: 12 Falcon 9 Missions in a Single Month  In pursuit of its ambitious objective to conduct 150 missions in 2024, SpaceX has reached a significant milestone by completing 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month. SpaceX closed the month of March with this achievement, which underscores SpaceX’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of space exploration.  SpaceX has been on a trajectory of remarkable growth, surpassing its own records year after year. In 2020 it launched 26 missions, 31 in 2021, and doubled that with 61 missions in 2022. By 2023, the company delivered approximately 80% of all Earth payload mass to orbit with 96 missions completed, outpacing competitors like China and other global players.  The pace of SpaceX’s launches has been accelerating steadily, with the company averaging one launch every four days throughout 2023. This rapid cadence reflects SpaceX’s dedication to innovation & efficiency in space travel.  SpaceX has already completed 32 missions in 2024. The recent accomplishment in March, where SpaceX completed 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month, demonstrates the company’s ability to meet & exceed its ambitious goals with a launch rate of one every 2.8 days. “Falcon 9 successfully launched our 11th and 12th missions of the month from Florida earlier today,” announced the company on March 31. The missions deployed Eutelsat 36D satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit from NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad-39A. And approximately “3.5 hours later, Falcon 9 launched 23 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit from pad 40, completing our 260th reflight of an orbital class rocket on the seven-year anniversary of first achieving this feat,” shared the company.  Key to SpaceX’s success is the reusability of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which enables the company to significantly increase its launch pace while reducing costs. SpaceX has reused multiple boosters in its Falcon 9 fleet 19 times, & engineers are working to qualify Falcon 9 for up to 40 reflights each.  As of now, SpaceX has performed a total of 327 missions, landed orbital-class rockets 291 times, and reused previously-flown Falcon 9 boosters in its fleet 261 times. With each milestone achieved, SpaceX reaffirms its position at the forefront of space exploration, inspiring admiration for its groundbreaking achievements. As the company continues to push boundaries and reach new heights, the future of space exploration looks brighter than ever before.  ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───  Author @JaneidyEve  Read more at Cosmic Chronicles: https://cosmicchroniclesnews.com/2024/04/02/spacex-achieves-ambitious-goal-12-falcon-9-missions-in-a-single-month/   Thanks for reading!

"Under the hood update: Introducing Topic Models, which improve Community Notes’ ability to identify notes that are helpful to people from different points of view.  Community Notes shows notes that are found helpful by people who’ve disagreed in their past ratings. Now, it will factor in both whether raters have disagreed in general as well as on the specific topic of the note. This strengthens the algorithm’s ability to find notes that bridge across topics. We’re initially trialing a small set of Topic Models and will monitor their effectiveness at identifying broadly helpful notes.  As always, code and details are open-source in GitHub, and your feedback helps drive improvements like this one: https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/commit/82b704c652eac94500f70a19e4f27a5ba842b430",2024-03,0,3
