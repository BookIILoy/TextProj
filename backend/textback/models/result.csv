"O governo brasileiro quer censurar as teorias da conspiração e ainda assim aqui está, espalhando teorias da conspiração: "" O governo brasileiro suspeita que os ataques de Elon Musk ao ministro Alexandre de Moraes e agora também diretamente ao presidente Lula estão sendo feitos em cooperativa com deputados bolsonaristas..."" relata a CNN.  A CNN publicou este segmento embora admitisse que “Ainda não temos provas sobre isso, está sendo investigado”.  Boa sorte em encontrar evidências porque não há nenhuma!  Fui convidado há muitos meses para palestrar no Fórum pela Liberdade no Rio Grande do Sul. Antes de chegar, meus colegas jornalistas brasileiros, David Agape e Eli Viera, me pediram para ver se havia algum arquivo do Twitter no Brasil.  Olhei e descobri que havia. O que descobrimos nos chocou: Alexandre de Moraes e outros funcionários do governo ameaçaram processar criminalmente o advogado do Twitter no Brasil se ele não entregasse informações *privadas* e *pessoais*, incluindo números de telefone das pessoas e suas mensagens diretas pessoais!  Publiquei os Arquivos do Twitter logo após desembarcar em Porto Alegre.  *Ninguém* além de David, Eli e mais um colega meu sabia que eu iria publicar o Twitter Files Brasil.  Depois que ficou claro que muitos brasileiros estavam interessados em falar comigo sobre os Arquivos do Twitter, adiei em uma semana meu retorno aos EUA. Depois que decidi fazer isso, o Diputado Federal Marcel Van Hattem cancelou a sua viagem há muito planejada a Bruxelas.  Conheci Van Hattem em Londres no ano passado, numa conferência, e ele estava no Fórum pela Liberdade, em Porto Alegre. Aceitei com gratidão a oferta de Van Hattem de ser apresentado a diversas pessoas que ele conhecia no Brasil.  É isso. Essa é toda a “coordenação”. Se a CNN tivesse feito o seu trabalho, poderia ter aprendido tudo isto comigo antes de publicar a sua “desinformação”. Na verdade, a CNN me entrevistou há duas noites e contei aos dois repórteres como surgiu o Twitter Files – Brasil. Aparentemente, os repórteres da CNN não conversam entre si.  Aparentemente, a CNN também não fez o dever de casa com Elon Musk. Com Elon, o que você vê é o que você obtém. Ele respondeu publicamente ao Twitter Files Brasil. Não falamos sobre eles nem nos correspondemos sobre eles. Ele ouviu falar deles no mesmo momento em que o mundo ouviu falar deles.  Será realmente tão difícil acreditar que os políticos que foram censurados tenham respondido em X a mais provas das exigências de censura de Moraes? Que idiota.  Estou tentando ser gentil com isso, mas com o segmento abaixo, a CNN não está se comportando como uma mídia de notícias justa e equilibrada. Está se comportando como um teórico da conspiração irresponsável, carregando água para o governo Lula.  Pelo menos você não me verá exigindo que o governo censure a CNN.",2024-04,0,4

"Read this.  NPR veteran describes the transformation of NPR from a news to an activist organization after Trump's election:  ""During most of my tenure [at NPR], an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding.  In recent years, however, that has changed. Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population...  Like many unfortunate things, the rise of advocacy took off with Donald Trump. As in many newsrooms, his election in 2016 was greeted at NPR with a mixture of disbelief, anger, and despair... But what began as tough, straightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency [italics mine].  Persistent rumors that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the election became the catnip that drove reporting. At NPR, we hitched our wagon to Trump’s most visible antagonist, Representative Adam Schiff...  The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.  But when the Mueller report found no credible evidence of collusion, NPR’s coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming...  It’s bad to blow a big story.  What’s worse is to pretend it never happened, to move on with no mea culpas, no self-reflection...  [Hunter Biden's] laptop was newsworthy. But the timeless journalistic instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched. During a meeting with colleagues, I listened as one of NPR’s best and most fair-minded journalists said it was good we weren’t following the laptop story because it could help Trump [italics mine]...  Over the course of the pandemic, a number of investigative journalists made compelling, if not conclusive, cases for the lab leak. But at NPR, we weren’t about to swivel or even tiptoe away from the insistence with which we backed the natural origin story...  [Our new director] declared that diversity—on our staff and in our audience—was the overriding mission... Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace. Journalists were required to ask everyone we interviewed their race, gender, and ethnicity (among other questions), and had to enter it in a centralized tracking system [italics mine]. We were given unconscious bias training sessions. A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to 'start talking about race.'  There’s an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they should be framed. It’s frictionless—one story after another about instances of supposed racism, transphobia, signs of the climate apocalypse, Israel doing something bad, and the dire threat of Republican policies. It’s almost like an assembly line.  The mindset prevails in choices about language. In a document called NPR Transgender Coverage Guidance—disseminated by news management—we’re asked to avoid the term biological sex... The mindset animates bizarre stories—on how The Beatles and bird names are racially problematic, and others that are alarmingly divisive; justifying looting, with claims that fears about crime are racist; and suggesting that Asian Americans who oppose affirmative action have been manipulated by white conservatives.  More recently, we have approached the Israel-Hamas war and its spillover onto streets and campuses through the intersectional lens that has jumped from the faculty lounge to newsrooms. Oppressor versus oppressed...  I looked at voter registration for our newsroom. In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.""  https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust",2024-04,2,4

"𝕮𝖔𝖘𝖒𝖎𝖈 𝕮𝖍𝖗𝖔𝖓𝖎𝖈𝖑𝖊𝖘 SpaceX Achieves Ambitious Goal: 12 Falcon 9 Missions in a Single Month  In pursuit of its ambitious objective to conduct 150 missions in 2024, SpaceX has reached a significant milestone by completing 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month. SpaceX closed the month of March with this achievement, which underscores SpaceX’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of space exploration.  SpaceX has been on a trajectory of remarkable growth, surpassing its own records year after year. In 2020 it launched 26 missions, 31 in 2021, and doubled that with 61 missions in 2022. By 2023, the company delivered approximately 80% of all Earth payload mass to orbit with 96 missions completed, outpacing competitors like China and other global players.  The pace of SpaceX’s launches has been accelerating steadily, with the company averaging one launch every four days throughout 2023. This rapid cadence reflects SpaceX’s dedication to innovation & efficiency in space travel.  SpaceX has already completed 32 missions in 2024. The recent accomplishment in March, where SpaceX completed 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month, demonstrates the company’s ability to meet & exceed its ambitious goals with a launch rate of one every 2.8 days. “Falcon 9 successfully launched our 11th and 12th missions of the month from Florida earlier today,” announced the company on March 31. The missions deployed Eutelsat 36D satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit from NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad-39A. And approximately “3.5 hours later, Falcon 9 launched 23 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit from pad 40, completing our 260th reflight of an orbital class rocket on the seven-year anniversary of first achieving this feat,” shared the company.  Key to SpaceX’s success is the reusability of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which enables the company to significantly increase its launch pace while reducing costs. SpaceX has reused multiple boosters in its Falcon 9 fleet 19 times, & engineers are working to qualify Falcon 9 for up to 40 reflights each.  As of now, SpaceX has performed a total of 327 missions, landed orbital-class rockets 291 times, and reused previously-flown Falcon 9 boosters in its fleet 261 times. With each milestone achieved, SpaceX reaffirms its position at the forefront of space exploration, inspiring admiration for its groundbreaking achievements. As the company continues to push boundaries and reach new heights, the future of space exploration looks brighter than ever before.  ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───  Author @JaneidyEve  Read more at Cosmic Chronicles: https://cosmicchroniclesnews.com/2024/04/02/spacex-achieves-ambitious-goal-12-falcon-9-missions-in-a-single-month/   Thanks for reading!

Community Notes shows notes that are found helpful by people who’ve disagreed in their past ratings. Now, it will factor in both whether raters have disagreed in general as well as on the specific topic of the note. This strengthens the algorithm’s ability to find notes that bridge across topics. We’re initially trialing a small set of Topic Models and will monitor their effectiveness at identifying broadly helpful notes.  As always, code and details are open-source in GitHub, and your feedback helps drive improvements like this one: https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/commit/82b704c652eac94500f70a19e4f27a5ba842b430",2024-03,1,3

"Because I am raising concerns about the flood of unvetted illegal immigrants overwhelming American cities, the press will often characterize me as “anti-immigrant”.   As an immigrant myself, nothing could be further from the truth.   I am very much in favor of increased and expedited legal immigration for anyone who is talented, hard-working and honest.   It is bizarrely difficult and agonizingly slow to immigrate to the USA legally, but trivial and fast to enter illegally! This obviously makes no sense.",2024-03,1,3

Senate Democrats just voted unanimously to defeat an amendment that would have stopped counting illegals for congressional seat apportionment and electoral college (presidential) votes.   Since illegals are mostly in Democrat states, both the House and the Presidential vote are shifted ~5% to the left, which is enough to change the entire balance of power!  This is a major reason why the Biden administration is ushering in record levels of illegals and doing so few deportations.",2024-03,0,3

"In case you were wondering how superconductors work, this is a good explanation. They are a very interesting phenomenon and may prove economically useful, but are not a hard requirement for a sustainable energy future.   Physics has many powerful tools of reasoning to understand and predict reality. Those tools, like first principles analysis and thinking in the limit, are broadly applicable to anything, in my experience.  With Grok, @xAI is attempting to create an AI that reasons from first principles, which is fundamental if you care about getting as close to the truth as possible.   The acid test would be reaching a conclusion that is correct even if it is extremely unpopular, which means being right even when the training data is almost entirely wrong.   For example, Galileo concluded, after observing the moons of Jupiter from a telescope he engineered, that it was far more probable that Earth revolved around the Sun than the other way around. This view was so unpopular that he was forced to recant and placed under house arrest!  If you had trained an LLM on material back then, it would’ve given you the popular, but wrong, explanation. Due to social and legal pressure, it likely wouldn’t even acknowledge the possibility that the Earth revolved around the Sun.  For AI to help us understand the true nature of the universe, it must be able to discard the popular, but wrong, in favor of the unpopular, but right.",2024-03,1,3
"I had a conversation with a friend this week about how we all become captured by culture wars.  We can call it The Culture War’s Shiny Object Cycle.  Here is how it goes:  1. Some woke news story hits the press.  -“Cats suffer from racial discrimination or screwing in lightbulbs needs to be recognised as a valid sexual kink or something.”  2. The Right Wing antibody response activates.  -“Look at how insane these people are. *Matt Walsh quote tweets the article and calls it obnoxious* This is the problem with our convenient, decadent, TikTok society.”  3. This reaction causes the story to gain infinitely more traction than it ever would have done by signal boosting the original fringe-scenario into a much bigger event. ​ 4. The Left Wing counter-response activates.  -“Right wingers lose their minds over one woman with a particularly dark cat. The Daily Wire has meltdown over insignificant troll article.”  -In times where the original story is less insane, this includes a defence of the original article too. “Cats actually CAN experience trauma, minimising this is the REAL problem.”  5. The Right Wing re-reaction kicks into gear.  -“Apparently I’m insane for pushing back against Cat Trauma. See this is the problem, if we don’t stand our ground, these blue haired idiots will take over the country.”  6. Finally, the Touch Grass Meta-Reactionaries steam in.  -“The real issue is people talking about this issue. Look at how silly this whole thing is. It’s time to check out of the culture war. We should reconnect with what really matters. You should move onto the ranch next to Ryan Holiday and hammer fence posts into the ground for the rest of time.”  This cycle is banal.  It’s excruciatingly repetitive.  So why does it sustain our attention if basically every discussion follows the same cycle?  Because each story is sprinkled with just enough novelty to give it the illusion that this is a new, different event.  Which legitimates the pushback… “We’ve not seen THIS Trans Flag with People Who Suffer From A Gluten Intolerance included in it before.”  It’s like a 20th season of Lost where they’re back on an island for the 7th time and need to escape, but THIS TIME IT’S WINTER.  The Culture War’s Shiny Object Cycle does my head in.  It does my head in because I get captured by it.  I see a bank rewriting classic fairy tales into a boss-bitch remake called Fairer Tales: Princesses Doing It For Themselves and think “this is fucking dumb, where’s Douglas Murray, I need him to decimate this idea with me.”  It’s cathartic.  Calling out insane ideas written by idiots is so compelling and fun and easy to do that it’s like being a cocaine addict with Pablo Escobar as a next door neighbour.  The memes of production are whirring at maximum RPM and we’re all caught in the vortex.  It was Douglas who reminded me why I’m getting so exasperated with this cycle.  It is a distraction.  A distraction from our attention being focussed on things which are actually meaningful.  Not just meaningful in a “will you remember this when you’re dead”-way.  But in a “there’s other issues that are more important to talk about”-way too.  There’s entire American cities with fentanyl epidemics.  80% of suicides of people aged 18 to 24 are men.  I want to hear Peterson talk about dealing with finding meaning in a world stripped of all its guard rails.  I want Taleb to be writing about applying complex maths to simple life problems.  Many of the smartest people on the planet have had their attention captured arguing about whether men are men and women are women or not over the last few years.  And even more of the normal ones too.  All of our collective minds are held hostage by an endless cycle of shiny objects that aggravate both sides and makes them feel righteous for standing their ground.  I think this is a bottomless pit.  I don’t think it’s going to stop.  I will almost certainly bring up stories like these in future.  But I’m gonna try hard to focus more on stuff that matters in 50 years, not just in 50 minutes.  And probably so should you.",2024-03,1,3
