People want more storytelling in YouTube content and not just ADHD fast paced videos. Which is why my new video is over 40 minutes and has the most depth of any of our videos! My goal is to show it works so more creators switch over ❤️🫡,2024-04,0,4

"It’s painful to see people quit their job/drop out of school to make content full time before they’re ready. For every person like me that makes it, thousands don’t. Keep that in mind and be smart plz",2024-03,0,3
"Fun fact, the stores on the border sold out first. People would buy every bar in every Walmart/Target in a city and then drive into Mexico or Canada and resell them 😅  Once I catch up to USA demand I’ll prio launching Mexico/Canada so they stop draining stores here",2024-03,0,3
Feastables is basically sold out at the moment (around 20% of stores still have some) I’m doing everything I can to get some more chocolate factories up and running! Sorry for not being able to buy it right now :/,2024-03,0,3

"The reason I’m doing all this investigation is I had tons of Feastables promo planned but I don’t want to send people to stores if shelves are empty. Don’t want to waste people’s time, after 4 days of restocking shelves I’ve concluded I should chill on the promo for a bit to not waste people’s time.",2024-02,0,2
If you run a business you’d find this interesting. A store forgot to put out our 35g milk chocolate bar and on the 16th I put the box from the back of store to checkout (where it was supposed to be) and look at our sales the following days at that checkout lane lol,2024-02,0,2
Some stores I visit like this target sold out of all the inventory sent (the inventory was supposed to last weeks not a few days lol). Doing my best to get new product to stores like these. Problem is I only have so many bars and idk how to distribute them optimally lol,2024-02,0,2
Found another one. Sales were good then they dropped to 0. I helped restock the shelve and now they went back up at this store 🥰,2024-02,0,2
I spent 15 hours yesterday visiting Walmarts/Targets and seeing if they had inventory in the back and helping them put it out.   This store was doing 0 sales and when I visited it had 0 product on shelf. I found these in the backroom and had them scan them in/I placed them on the shelf. The store then started selling a bar an hour haha  Most products don’t have velocities like ours so you have to stock the shelves more frequently or they sit empty and people don’t have anything to buy. Learning a lot!,2024-02,0,2

"MY FIRST X VIDEO MADE OVER $250,000! 😲  But it’s a bit of a facade. Advertisers saw the attention it was getting and bought ads on my video (I think) and thus my revenue per view is prob higher than what you’d experience",2024-01,0,1

What’s interesting is it’s with a closed mouth thumbnail (thank gosh open mouth was cringe)  I screamed way less in the video lol  We slowed the video down a lot  Showed more of me and the boys being dumb  cut less than I normally do  And it seems like everyone liked the changes. Hopefully other creators notice because I feel like in general content on YouTube has gotten to fast paced/tense and I want to lead by example and show that viewers don’t want that. Focus less on screaming/moving fast and more on story!,2023-10,1,10
