People want more storytelling in YouTube content and not just ADHD fast paced videos. Which is why my new video is over 40 minutes and has the most depth of any of our videos! My goal is to show it works so more creators switch over ❤️🫡,2024-04,0,4
This is what it looks like behind the scenes when we have 100 contestants and 300 cameras haha,2024-04,0,4

"I built 100 wells in Africa to provide clean drinking water for up to 500,000 people! This is one of my favorite videos I’ve ever made 🥰 (all ad rev will go towards getting people in need water)",2024-04,0,4
So far it’s been around a million in ad revenue. I’m just adding it to my video budgets so now I can spend more on content lol,2024-04,0,4

"Every time I send out a shipment of Feastables  they sell out. I’m trying to get it where you all can actually try it, sorry for taking so long 🙃",2024-03,0,3
Let me know if you like the editing style of the new video! It’s slower and especially toward the end shows more depth of what we’re experiencing than I used to show. I think we’re on to something :),2024-03,1,3
"I was just looking over all the Beast Philanthropy videos and the impact so far is insane! We’ve also given 20,000,000 meals to people in need (avg around 2M meals a month now🥰)  I want to give praise to my partner Darren, he’s the maniac that doesn’t sleep, most selfless person I know, and why these projects happen ❤️",2024-03,0,3

"I gave someone a Lamborghini but they had to catch it from a 100 foot drop, stop a train from hitting it, protect it from navy seals, etc   You def want to watch this one",2024-03,1,3
Now if you want to mortgage your home and bet your net worth on black in roulette… that I support,2024-03,0,3
"It’s painful to see people quit their job/drop out of school to make content full time before they’re ready. For every person like me that makes it, thousands don’t. Keep that in mind and be smart plz",2024-03,0,3
"Fun fact, the stores on the border sold out first. People would buy every bar in every Walmart/Target in a city and then drive into Mexico or Canada and resell them 😅  Once I catch up to USA demand I’ll prio launching Mexico/Canada so they stop draining stores here",2024-03,0,3
Feastables is basically sold out at the moment (around 20% of stores still have some) I’m doing everything I can to get some more chocolate factories up and running! Sorry for not being able to buy it right now :/,2024-03,0,3

"This past year i’ve slowed down our videos, focused on story telling, let scenes breathe, yelled less, more personality, longer videos, etc. And our views have skyrocketed!   My fellow YouTubers lets get rid of the ultra fast paced/overstim era of content. It doesn’t even work 💀",2024-03,1,3
"The reason I’m doing all this investigation is I had tons of Feastables promo planned but I don’t want to send people to stores if shelves are empty. Don’t want to waste people’s time, after 4 days of restocking shelves I’ve concluded I should chill on the promo for a bit to not waste people’s time.",2024-02,0,2
If you run a business you’d find this interesting. A store forgot to put out our 35g milk chocolate bar and on the 16th I put the box from the back of store to checkout (where it was supposed to be) and look at our sales the following days at that checkout lane lol,2024-02,0,2
Some stores I visit like this target sold out of all the inventory sent (the inventory was supposed to last weeks not a few days lol). Doing my best to get new product to stores like these. Problem is I only have so many bars and idk how to distribute them optimally lol,2024-02,0,2
Found another one. Sales were good then they dropped to 0. I helped restock the shelve and now they went back up at this store 🥰,2024-02,0,2
I spent 15 hours yesterday visiting Walmarts/Targets and seeing if they had inventory in the back and helping them put it out.   This store was doing 0 sales and when I visited it had 0 product on shelf. I found these in the backroom and had them scan them in/I placed them on the shelf. The store then started selling a bar an hour haha  Most products don’t have velocities like ours so you have to stock the shelves more frequently or they sit empty and people don’t have anything to buy. Learning a lot!,2024-02,0,2
"I’m seeing this a lot, doing everything I can to restock stores with the new Feastables bar, only so many I can put on a shelf 😅❤️",2024-02,0,2
